#Enquire products in Drupal 7
=============================

Drupal 7 module to create enquire list of nodes. This module create 
a button with the selected text into the content type adding it as a field. 
The list of nodes will be load as a block.

##Further improvements

* As a alpha module, the fields to show in the list have to be created automatically. We are working hard to add that feature totally custom for the user.
* Can be interesting to have the posibility to add more than one list with different enquires button.

##Requeriments
